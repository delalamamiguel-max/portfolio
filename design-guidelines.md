Design Guidelines

Architected by Miguel
Strategy × Systems × Executive Calm

⸻

Emotional Thesis

Feels like a quiet executive strategy deck — calm on the surface, with a visible systems spine underneath.

Executive calm draws attention.
Structured depth sustains it.

Grounded in the “Kindness in Design” philosophy from design-tips.md:
	•	Power without aggression
	•	Precision without noise
	•	Control without urgency
	•	Systems thinking without intimidation

This portfolio should feel intentional, measured, and architected.

⸻

Emotional Intent (Before Visual Decisions)

The interface must make users feel:
	•	Calm
	•	Confident
	•	Safe exploring depth
	•	Intellectually respected
	•	Not overwhelmed

If any screen creates urgency, clutter, or decorative distraction — simplify.

⸻

Visual System

⸻

Typography

Design Intent

Typography communicates authority first, technical depth second.

Surface → Executive clarity
Depth → Structured precision

Hierarchy must be obvious at a glance. Recruiters skim.

⸻

Type Hierarchy

H1 — Strategic Authority
	•	40–48px
	•	Weight 600–700
	•	Slightly condensed sans-serif
	•	Tight letter spacing (-1% to -2%)

Used for:
	•	Homepage hero
	•	Major section openers

⸻

H2 — Structural Sections
	•	28–32px
	•	Weight 600
	•	Clean geometric sans

Used for:
	•	Case study sections
	•	Philosophy titles
	•	Resume sections

⸻

H3 — Analytical Subsections
	•	20–22px
	•	Weight 600

Used for:
	•	Architecture layers
	•	Governance trade-offs
	•	Execution blocks

⸻

Body
	•	16–18px
	•	Weight 400–500
	•	Line-height ≥ 1.6

Readable. Airy. Never dense.

⸻

Monospace Accent (Systems Signal)

Used selectively for:
	•	Architecture labels
	•	Tags
	•	System references
	•	Governance constraints

Purpose:

Signal technical literacy without overwhelming executive tone.

Never use monospace for long paragraphs.

⸻

Color System

Two-layer emotional structure.

⸻

Primary Background

Deep Executive Navy
#0F172A
RGB: 15, 23, 42

Emotion: Controlled. Strategic. High-trust.

⸻

Primary Accent

Strategic Blue
#2563EB
RGB: 37, 99, 235

Used for:
	•	Primary buttons
	•	Focus states
	•	Links

Emotion: Intelligent momentum.

⸻

Secondary Accent

Systems Teal
#14B8A6
RGB: 20, 184, 166

Used for:
	•	Architecture highlights
	•	System references
	•	Subtle accents

Emotion: Data fluency.

⸻

Impact Highlight

Metrics Green
#22C55E
RGB: 34, 197, 94

Used only for:
	•	% lifts
	•	Cost savings
	•	Quantified impact

Green must remain rare to preserve credibility.

⸻

Text Colors

Primary Text:
#E5E7EB

Muted Text:
#94A3B8

All combinations must maintain ≥ 4.5:1 contrast.

⸻

Spacing & Layout System

⸻

Grid Logic
	•	8pt base grid
	•	Section padding:
	•	Desktop: 96px
	•	Tablet: 64px
	•	Mobile: 48px
	•	Card padding:
	•	24px or 32px
	•	Max width:
	•	1100–1200px

No arbitrary spacing.

⸻

Homepage Layout
	•	Large vertical spacing
	•	Wide margins
	•	Low density
	•	Strong separation between sections

Feels like a board-ready slide.

⸻

Case Study Layout
	•	Slightly denser than homepage
	•	Sticky side navigation
	•	Anchor-linked sections
	•	Clear content blocks
	•	Visual hierarchy preserved

Feels like an internal executive document.

⸻

Responsive Rules

Mobile-first.

Breakpoints:
	•	≥ 768px tablet
	•	≥ 1024px desktop
	•	≥ 1280px large desktop

Never collapse hierarchy on mobile.
Reduce scale, not clarity.

⸻

Motion & Interaction

Aligned with kindness philosophy.

Motion communicates control — not excitement.

⸻

Duration
	•	200–300ms
	•	Ease-in-out
	•	No exaggerated bounce
	•	No theatrical transitions

⸻

Hover States

Cards:
	•	Slight elevation
	•	Subtle shadow
	•	Border highlight (blue or teal)

Buttons:
	•	Gentle opacity shift or glow
	•	No aggressive scaling

⸻

Page Transitions
	•	Soft fade-in (150–250ms)
	•	No sliding panels unless functional

⸻

Empty States

Tone:
	•	Calm
	•	Encouraging
	•	Neutral

Example:

“No case studies published yet. The system is still being architected.”

Never shame. Never rush.

⸻

Voice & Tone

⸻

Emotional Keywords
	•	Precise
	•	Structured
	•	Measured
	•	Confident
	•	Strategic

Avoid:
	•	Hype
	•	Buzzwords
	•	Exaggeration
	•	Overclaiming

⸻

Microcopy Examples

Login:

Title:
Access case studies

Subtext:
Shared privately.

Error:
Incorrect password. Try again.

⸻

CTA Examples:
	•	Explore case studies

⸻

Contact:

“If you’re building intelligent platforms at scale, let’s talk.”

⸻

System Consistency Rules

⸻

Recurring Patterns
	•	Section headers always left-aligned
	•	Metrics always paired with explanation
	•	Architecture sections use monospace labels
	•	Impact always quantified
	•	Buttons consistent across pages

⸻

Style Anchors

Inspired by:
	•	Linear (clarity)
	•	Apple executive pages (restraint)
	•	shadcn/ui (component discipline)

No stylistic experimentation per page.

Consistency compounds credibility.

⸻

Accessibility

Executive presence requires clarity.

⸻

Semantic Structure

	•	Landmark regions defined
	•	Navigation properly labeled

⸻

Keyboard Navigation

	•	Logical tab order
	•	Login usable without mouse

⸻

Contrast
	•	Text ≥ 4.5:1
	•	Large text ≥ 3:1
	•	Avoid low-opacity decorative text

⸻

Minimum Text Size
	•	Body ≥ 16px
	•	Never use 12px body text

⸻

Emotional Audit Checklist

Before launch or after major change:
	•	Does this feel calm?
	•	Does it communicate strategic authority?
	•	Is anything decorative?
	•	Is depth revealed gradually?
	•	Would a CTO feel aligned?
	•	Would a VP Product feel confident?

If uncertain, simplify.

⸻

Technical QA Checklist
	•	Typography matches defined scale.
	•	8pt grid applied consistently.
	•	No inconsistent spacing.
	•	Motion between 150–300ms.
	•	Contrast validated.
	•	Focus states visible.
	•	Auth redirect smooth.
	•	Mobile preserves hierarchy.

⸻

Adaptive System Memory

If this design system evolves:

Ask:
	•	Should deep navy remain brand anchor?
	•	Should teal remain systems signal?
	•	Should Strategy Lens become reusable pattern?
	•	Should executive minimalism remain primary identity?

Design consistency compounds brand authority.

⸻

Design Integrity Review

The emotional and technical intent align:
	•	Navy foundation anchors authority.
	•	Structured typography reinforces strategic clarity.
	•	Controlled motion communicates confidence.
	•	Hybrid auth reinforces intentional depth.
	•	Minimal UI respects attention.

One improvement for stronger harmony:

Introduce a subtle architectural motif (thin grid lines or faint diagram overlays in background sections) to reinforce builder identity without increasing noise.
