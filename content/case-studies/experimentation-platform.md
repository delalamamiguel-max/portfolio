## Strategic Context
Fragmented testing practices slowed prioritization and reduced decision confidence.

## Architecture
Built unified instrumentation, targeting controls, and standardized analysis workflows.

## Trade-offs
Traded local autonomy for global consistency in experiment design and readouts.

## Execution
Established shared operating cadence and launch governance across product surfaces.

## Impact
Increased engagement by 12% and cut experiment cycle time by 35%.

## What's Next
Introduce adaptive allocation and automated anomaly detection for experiment safety.
