## Strategic Context

How a machine learning model built on five years of historical data reduced operational planning time by up to 70% and secured stakeholder buy-in at Saatchi and Saatchi Conill, part of Publicis Groupe, one of the top three global advertising networks.

**BACKGROUND**

**Context: Who and What**

Saatchi and Saatchi Conill is part of Publicis Groupe, one of the top three global advertising networks. The agency serves major clients across industries, with resource allocation and annual budget planning sitting at the core of how client work is scoped, talent is assigned, and spend is planned across a full fiscal year.

This product was conceived, architected, and led from within the Digital Innovations team, an internal group built specifically to identify and develop technology solutions that could modernize how the agency operated. The predictive resource allocation model was the flagship initiative of that team, trained on five years of historical project and resource data.

**THE CHALLENGE**

**A Useful Model Nobody Trusted**

The agency had developed a predictive model intended to help teams scope client engagements and build annual budget plans more efficiently. Despite its potential value, adoption was low. Stakeholders were skeptical of the model's accuracy and found its outputs difficult to translate into real decisions.

Key pain points included:

- Skepticism about model accuracy made managers reluctant to rely on its recommendations over their own judgment
- Outputs lacked the context and clarity needed to translate predictions into concrete staffing or budget decisions
- No feedback mechanism existed, so errors in the model had no path to correction
- Manual resource planning remained the default, keeping operational overhead high and planning cycles slow

**THE SOLUTION**

**A Rebuilt Model with a Human-Centered Adoption Strategy**

The solution addressed both the technical and human sides of the adoption problem. On the technical side, the model was rebuilt with an expanded dataset and refined logic to improve reliability. On the human side, the rollout was redesigned to build trust incrementally through workshops, intuitive dashboards, and a feedback loop that gave managers a direct voice in improving the model over time.

The entire initiative was conceived, architected, and led internally, with the Digital Innovations team driving product strategy, stakeholder engagement, data science partnership, and engineering delivery end to end.

**KEY DESIGN DECISIONS**

**How We Built It**

- Expanded dataset and model refinement. Partnering with data scientists, the model was retrained on five years of historical resource and project data, improving its predictive reliability across client types and engagement sizes.
- Intuitive dashboards for actionable insights. The interface was redesigned so managers could see clear, plain-language recommendations rather than raw model outputs, making it easier to act on predictions with confidence.
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement. Key leaders and managers were given the ability to flag disagreements with the model's recommendations in real time, feeding corrections back into future iterations.
- MVP-first rollout with smaller teams. Rather than launching broadly, the revised model was validated with a subset of teams first, confirming performance before scaling to the wider organization.

**EXECUTION AND COLLABORATION**

**Turning Skeptics into Champions**

The first step was not building anything. It was listening. Structured stakeholder conversations were conducted across the organization to uncover the specific concerns driving low adoption. Two themes emerged consistently: doubt about accuracy and frustration with outputs that were hard to act on.

Key execution steps:

- Conducted stakeholder interviews to surface the specific accuracy concerns and usability gaps driving low adoption, rather than assuming what the problems were
- Ran workshops to explain the model's logic, demonstrate its benefits with real examples, and give stakeholders a chance to raise objections in a structured setting
- Partnered with data scientists to expand the training dataset and refine the model based on the patterns stakeholders flagged as unreliable
- Collaborated with engineering to design and launch an MVP with a select group of smaller teams, validating the improved model in a controlled environment before broader rollout
- Built and managed the feedback loop that allowed managers to flag recommendations in real time, creating a living improvement cycle rather than a static release

**RESULTS AND IMPACT**

**From Distrust to Adoption, with Measurable Efficiency Gains**

Beyond the headline metrics, the initiative delivered lasting organizational value:

- Stakeholder buy-in was secured across leadership levels, transforming the model from a shelved tool into a core part of the annual planning process
- The feedback loop created an ongoing improvement cycle, meaning the model continued to get more accurate over time without requiring full retraining efforts
- Funding was secured for future Digital Innovations initiatives based on the demonstrated performance and business impact of this model
- The MVP validation approach established a repeatable playbook for introducing ML-powered tools to skeptical internal audiences

**LEARNINGS AND WHAT'S NEXT**

**Key Takeaways**

- Trust is a product requirement, not a communications problem. Redesigning the interface and adding a feedback loop addressed the adoption gap more effectively than any internal marketing campaign would have.
- Starting with skeptics rather than champions produces better products. The concerns raised by the most resistant stakeholders directly improved the model's accuracy and usability.
- MVP validation with smaller teams de-risks broader rollout. Proving the model's value in a contained environment gave leadership the confidence to approve full-scale adoption.

The foundation built by Scope IQ opened the door to several high-value extensions the team was positioned to pursue:

- Expand the model to cover additional client segments and engagement types not represented in the initial training data
- Integrate real-time project performance data to enable in-year resource reallocation, not just annual planning
- Apply the feedback loop architecture to other internal planning tools across the agency
