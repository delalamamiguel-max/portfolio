## Strategic Context

**BACKGROUND**

**Context: Who and What**

AT&T dot-com serves millions of customers across consumer and business segments, including a significant and growing Hispanic audience. Maintaining high-quality, localized content for this market required ongoing translation, content updates, and site maintenance. This work had historically been handled through external vendor contracts.

Fluently AI is an in-house AI-powered translation and content management platform built to replace that outsourced model entirely, enabling AT&T to deliver accurate, brand-consistent Spanish-language content at a fraction of the cost and time.

**THE CHALLENGE**

**High Costs, Slow Updates, Inconsistent Quality**

AT&T's reliance on outsourced vendors for Hispanic market content had created compounding operational problems. Translation turnaround times ranged from 24 to 72 hours, making it impossible to respond quickly to promotions, product changes, or time-sensitive market events. Costs were significant and growing, with no clear path to efficiency under the existing model.

Key pain points included:

- Outsourced vendor contracts drove high recurring costs with limited flexibility
- Translation turnaround of 24 to 72 hours prevented rapid response to market needs
- Inconsistent quality across vendors created brand and compliance risk
- Growing demand from the Hispanic audience made the existing model increasingly unsustainable

**THE SOLUTION**

**Fluently AI: An In-House Translation and Content Platform**

Fluently AI was designed as a generic, scalable product to replace the vendor dependency entirely. The platform automated translation workflows, standardized quality controls, and gave internal teams direct control over content updates without requiring external handoffs.

The architecture was built with future scalability in mind, enabling seamless addition of new languages to support AT&T's broader multilingual market ambitions beyond the initial Hispanic audience.

**KEY DESIGN DECISIONS**

**How We Built It**

- Scalable language architecture. The platform was designed from the start to support multiple languages, not just Spanish, positioning AT&T for future multilingual expansion without rebuilding the core system.
- Internal workflow ownership. By bringing translation and maintenance in-house, content teams gained direct control over update cycles, eliminating vendor coordination time entirely.
- Standardized quality controls. Consistent translation logic replaced the variability of multiple vendor outputs, improving brand alignment and reducing compliance review overhead.
- Integration with existing CMS. Fluently AI was built to work within the existing AT&T dot-com infrastructure, reducing deployment risk and avoiding a full platform replacement.

**EXECUTION AND COLLABORATION**

**Building a Cross-Functional Business Case**

The biggest challenge early on was alignment. Four distinct organizations had overlapping but sometimes conflicting priorities: CDL (Chief Data Office), MGO (Marketing Growth Organization), Mass Markets, and CTX (Consumer Technology Experience). Each had a stake in how content was managed and delivered for the Hispanic market.

Key execution steps:

- Conducted structured stakeholder interviews across CDL, MGO, Mass Markets, and CTX to understand individual objectives and surface shared pain points
- Synthesized cross-functional insights into a unified business case that reflected the priorities of all four organizations, making it easier for senior leadership to see the full value
- Secured executive buy-in and funding by presenting a compelling vision backed by cost data, market growth projections, and a clear path to in-house capability
- Established clear roles and accountability across teams after funding was confirmed, ensuring each group understood its contribution and how it connected to the broader initiative
- Built and managed a prioritized roadmap focused on high-impact features first, keeping the project on track and reducing scope creep during delivery

**RESULTS AND IMPACT**

**Measurable Wins Across Cost, Speed, and Quality**

Beyond the headline metrics, Fluently AI delivered meaningful strategic outcomes:

- AT&T now owns its Hispanic market content pipeline, reducing dependency on external vendors and giving internal teams full operational control
- The scalable language architecture positions AT&T to expand into additional multilingual markets without rebuilding the platform
- Improved translation consistency strengthened brand integrity and reduced the compliance review burden on legal and marketing teams
- The stakeholder alignment process became a model for how to build cross-functional buy-in for future platform initiatives

**LEARNINGS AND WHAT'S NEXT**

**Key Takeaways**

- Listening before pitching changes the quality of the business case. The stakeholder interview process surfaced insights that made the final proposal significantly stronger than any single-team perspective would have produced.
- Scalability has to be a first-class requirement, not an afterthought. Designing Fluently AI to support multiple languages from day one avoided a costly rebuild the moment a second language was requested.
- Vendor dependency is a strategic risk. The transition to an in-house platform eliminated not just cost but also the operational fragility that came with relying on external parties for time-sensitive content.

Planned next iterations:

- Expand Fluently AI to support additional multilingual markets beyond Spanish
- Integrate real-time content performance data to inform translation prioritization
- Explore applying the platform architecture to other AT&T digital properties beyond dot-com
