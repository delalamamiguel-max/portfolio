## Strategic Context
Legacy ranking systems were constraining iteration speed and model quality.

## Architecture
Implemented governed feature pipelines, model versioning, and observable serving layers.

## Trade-offs
Balanced rollout speed with model explainability and compliance constraints.

## Execution
Ran phased deployment with product, engineering, data science, and governance checkpoints.

## Impact
Improved CTR by 8% and reduced operating expense by $8M annually.

## What's Next
Expand reinforcement learning experimentation with stronger online evaluation controls.
